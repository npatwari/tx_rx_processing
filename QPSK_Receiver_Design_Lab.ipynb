    "This python notebook provides code to operate a QPSK demodulator in postprocesing for a signal recorded at a POWDER receiver. This includes perform frequency, phase, and symbol synchronization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Look for the raised hand icon ✋ to see things you need to change or check in order to successfully complete this receiver code. This receiver won't run if you don't complete these sections!\n",

    "## Setup this Python Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "✋ First, go to the file menu on the colab File menu and `Save a Copy in Drive`.  This is because the original shared doc is a read only copy.\n",

    "The following instructions assume you have the measurement zip file(s) from a run of Shout for a QPSK transmitter. For CyberPowder, this is on the Canvas `IH3: Hands-on Receiver Design` Page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In colab, we have to upload any file that colab needs besides this .ipynb file.  In particular we need to load the data files.  Currently colab requires us to upload one file at a time.  Because we're impatient, we zipped all of the data files together, and we'll upload that one zip file, and then unzip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To upload the file:\n",
    " - **Click on the folder icon** at the leftmost column of this page.  Then, you should see a `..` folder and a `sample_data` folder, and four icons above that directory listing.\n",
    " - **Click on the Upload icon**, which looks like a piece of paper with an up arrow on it.  \n",
    " - **Select and upload** the `<your-file-name>.zip` file (change to whatever your measurement zip file is called). It asks you to confirm that it will delete them when your session expires (which means you need to do it again if the session expires).  Click OK.\n",
    " - **Run the exec command below** (`!unzip <your-file-name>.zip`, where you type in your file's name); and then wait for it to upload, which may take a few seconds.\n"

This is so that if the receiver starts several samples late, or if the receiver must drop a certain number of samples in order to make sure that its queue is clear from the last sampling, we can still get the start of the packet.  Also it is useful to see periods of low power before a packet starts, it makes seeing the packet in signal plots easier.\n",

Because we're using QPSK (with 2 bits per symbol), these are two symbols that are opposite in phase.  The preamble is thus a total length of 64 bits or 32 symbols.\n",

    "The difference between the carrier frequency generated by the transmitter and the carrier frequency generated by the receiver is called the carrier *frequency offset*, and denoted Δf. This  frequency offset is observed in the received signal at this point -- its phase rotates over time, a full rotation every 1/Δf. Essentially, our desired received signal is multiplied by exp(j2πΔfnT), where exp() is the exponential function, j is the imaginary number, n is the sample number, and T is the sample period. Most receivers estimate Δf and multiply the signal by exp(-j2πΔfnT) to undo the problem. A typical frequency offset is on the order of a few kHz (1000 Hz).\n",

    "In POWDER, most nodes have white rabbit time and frequency synch enabled. Thus there should be 0 frequency offset if it is working. Sometimes, though, there is a problem and it is not working. It is a good idea to estimate the frequency offset, to make sure. If the frequency offset estimate is on the order of 10 Hz or less, the time sync is almost certainly working (and the non-zero estimate is just because of noise). If the frequency offset is on the order of kHz, then one or more of the nodes is not frequency synched."
